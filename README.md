### Hi there üëã

Hello there üëã, I hope you have an absolute masterpiece of days on end. I am known as Albert Starfield Wahyu Suryo Samudro, or through the legal name identified as Wahyu Suryo Samudro. Risen from Indonesian terrain. I extend my warm invitation to you, to contribute, and may our incredible journey of  projects, may be contributing to the pivotal force of etheral impact foundation of our paradigm itself.

I have to confess to you and declare to prevent misinformation, **I am NOT an AI engineer nor an Computer Science person**, It's just so happen that I have personal experience on Linux and Machine Learning. And I'm just a person that happens **reads the manual** rather than watching youtube tutorial, because most of the time there's a golden treasure hidden on the documentation itself.

Furthermore, I am more biased towards distributed indipendent non-subscription model services, that happen to able to stand by itself rather than relying on power hungry big Green GPUs and centralized and cloud-centric only paradigm. But I digress.

Mayhap you have found a kernel of intrigue within these musings. 

I hope you have an absolutely wonderful day, Until we meet again~
